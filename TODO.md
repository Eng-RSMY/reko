# TODO

The current version of Reko is quite crude and could use assistance.

* Support for more processor architectures and platforms. Currently Reko
  has support for x86, Motorola 68k, and MS-DOS, Win32, ELF, and Hunk
  executable formats. See the "How to..." wiki page for how to contribute
  new architectures and platforms.

* GUI: the work on a useful GUI hasn't left the planning stages; ideas about
  mouse/keyboard interaction to afford a convenient user interface are still mulled.

* Porting to other environments: a Mono/GTK# port is in the works.
